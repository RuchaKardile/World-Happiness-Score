# World-Happiness-Score

### Project Summary:
This repository contains code and data related to the analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset. The World Happiness Report is a significant survey assessing global happiness levels, utilizing data from the Gallup World Poll. The dataset includes happiness scores and rankings for various countries, alongside factors contributing to happiness such as economic production, social support, and life expectancy.

### Project Overview:
Below are the key steps undertaken in this project:

#### 1. Data Cleaning:
- Addressing missing values
- Standardizing data formats
- Handling outliers

#### 2. Combining Datasets:
- Consolidating data from different sources
- Creating a unified dataset for analysis

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzing distributions and correlations
- Visualizing trends and patterns
- Identifying potential insights

#### 4. Model Building:
- Implementing regression models to predict happiness scores
- Linear regression, Decision tree, KNN and different Ensemble methods have been used.

#### 5. Prediction with Best Fit Model:
- Utilizing the best performing model for predictions
- Assessing model accuracy and performance

#### 6. Model Deployment:
- Deploying the trained model for real-world applications

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding the analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset and the methodologies used for prediction and deployment.
